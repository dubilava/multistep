  Abstract                 = {In this paper we examine dynamic relationships among wheat prices from five countries for the years 1981–1999. Error correction models and directed acyclic graphs are employed with observational data to sort–out the dynamic causal relationships among prices from major wheat producing regions: Canada, the European Union, Argentina, Australia, and the United States. An ambiguity related to the cyclic or acyclic flow of information between Canada and Australia is uncovered. We condition our analysis on the assumption that information flow is acyclic. The empirical results show that Canada and the {U.S.} are leaders in the pricing of wheat in these markets. The {U.S.} has a significant effect on three markets excluding Canada.},

  Abstract                 = {The potential role of nonlinear dynamics in generating market instability is investigated using a simple market equilibrium model of the U.S. dairy industry. The supply function reflects the nonlinear dynamics of the dairy herd, as estimated by Chavas and Klemme. It is shown that, in the absence of any uncertainty, an inelastic demand contributes to market instability and chaos.},

  abstract  = {This paper is concerned with the estimation of a model in which a possibly serially correlated stochastic process, the \&quot;harvest\&quot; of an agricultural commodity, generates a competitive price in a market comprising both final consumers and risk-neutral speculators who can store the commodity at a cost in the anticipation of profit. Because storage cannot be negative, the relationship between prices and harvests is inherently nonlinear and is an unpromising candidate for a linear-quadratic model, or for linearization more generally. Instead, we calculate numerically a policy function in which price is a function of two unobservable state variables, the harvest and current availability, and we use the result to fit the price data.

This paper uses the disaster history database of the {U.S.} Agency for International Development's Office of {U.S.} Foreign Disaster Assistance to examine the link between {ENSO} events and droughts or floods of sufficient magnitude to trigger international disasters. Worldwide, disasters triggered by droughts are twice as frequent during year two of {ENSO} warm events than during other years. No such relationship is apparent in the case of flood disasters. Drought disasters occur during year two of {ENSO} warm events significantly more frequently than in other years in Southern Africa and Southeast Asia. No regional pattern emerges from a comparable analysis of flood disasters. Those places likely to be affected by {ENSO-triggered} droughts can take proactive measures to mitigate the impacts.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper reviews food (especially cereal) production trends and prospects for the world and its main regions. Despite fears to the contrary, in recent years we have seen continued progress toward better methods of feeding humanity. {Sub-Saharan} Africa is the sole major exception. Looking to the future, this paper argues that the continuation of recent cereal yield trends should be sufficient to cope with most of the demographically driven expansion of cereal demand that will occur until the year 2025. However, because of an increasing degree of mismatch between the expansion of regional demand and the potential for supply, there will be a major expansion of world cereal (and noncereal food) trade. Other consequences for global agriculture arising from demographic growth include the need to use water much more efficiently and an even greater dependence on nitrogen fertilizers (e.g., South Asia). Farming everywhere will depend more on information-intensive agricultural management procedures. Moreover, despite continued general progress, there still will be a significant number of undernourished people in 2025. Signs of heightened harvest variability, especially in North America, are of serious concern. Thus, although future general food trends are likely to be positive, in some respects we also could be entering a more volatile world.},

  Abstract                 = {A recently developed testing procedure is used to detect and date-stamp explosive episodes (�bubbles�) in corn, soybean, and wheat futures markets during 2004�2013. We find that the markets experienced price explosiveness only approximately two percent of the time and, when bubbles do occur, they are generally short-lived and small in magnitude. The correspondence between observed price spikes and bubbles is rather low, with a large portion of the price explosiveness occurring during downward price movements. Commodity index trader positions do not significantly affect the probability of a positive bubble occurring in grain futures markets, which directly contradicts the argument (the �Masters Hypothesis�) that waves of index investment distorted underlying supply-and-demand relationships and led to a series of massive bubbles in agricultural futures markets. In addition, commodity index trader positions tend to reduce negative bubble occurrence, while general speculative activity as measured by Working's T reduces the probability of a positive bubble. There is some evidence that the positions of noncommercial traders have a direct effect on positive bubble occurrence, but the effect declines when accounting for the composition of other traders in the market. Overall, speculation has little effect or negative effects on price explosiveness. Finally, positive bubbles are more likely to occur in the presence of low inventories, strong exports, a weak U.S. dollar, and booming economic growth, whereas negative bubbles are more likely to occur with large inventories, weak exports, and stagnant economic growth.},

  Abstract                 = {This article examines the persistence of shocks to international commodity prices from 1900 to 2008 using the updated Grilli Yang Index. The main innovation of this study is that it determines whether commodity prices are characterized by multiple changes in persistence. Specifically, bootstrap methods are used to estimate persistence, and the associated half-life shocks are calculated. We find that the persistence of shocks can vary widely depending on the individual commodity and the time period. The results suggest that policy-makers need to exercise caution when introducing measures to cushion the effect of shocks to world commodity prices.},

  Abstract                 = {The multivariate cointegration testing procedures recently developed by Johansen are used to evaluate the law of one price {(LOP)} for prices in five international wheat markets. Efficient arbitrage and trade activities should ensure that individual wheat prices in spatially separated markets are linked through a common long-run equilibrium. The results indicate that the {LOP} fails as a long-run equilibrium relationship when transportation costs are ignored. However, if wheat prices are adjusted for freight rates, the {LOP} is fully supported.},

  Abstract                 = {To prevent or prepare for future food shortages an understanding of the likely magnitude and distribution of future cereal yields is required. To this end, predictions of cereal yields have commonly been made, using various assumptions. However, the employed assumptions, namely, that yields tend to follow a given trend over time, have not been extensively tested. This study presents a test of the applicability of two general models to time series of maize {(Zea} mays L.), rice {(Oryza} sativa L.), and wheat {(Triticum} aestivum L.) yields for 188 nations to characterize past yield trends, to assess the relative importance of various trends on a global scale, and lastly, to determine what factors might be responsible for the presence of slowing yield growth and yield decline in some nations. Results showed that linear growth in yields has been the most common trend over time, occurring in more than half of all nation-crop data sets, and that growth significantly greater than 33.1\&\#xa0;kg\&\#xa0;ha−1\&\#xa0;yr−1 (the rate at which global cereal yields must grow to have the current per-capita production in 2050) constituted 20\% of the data sets and was the most important trend in terms of global area harvested, production, and population. A trend of slowing yield growth was present in roughly one-sixth of the data sets, and the nations that this subset comprised made a small contribution to global area harvested, production, and population (less than 10\%). Nation-crop data sets that showed yield growth greater than 33.1\&\#xa0;kg\&\#xa0;ha−1\&\#xa0;yr−1 had much greater yields than those that showed slowing yield growth, demonstrating that yield growth is not being limited by general physiological constraints to crop productivity. The results of a logistic regression procedure showed that the relative frequency of slowing yield growth and yield decline was negatively correlated to per-capita gross domestic product {(GDP)} for maize and wheat, and to growth in fertilizer rate for maize. In addition to {GDP}, latitude was negatively correlated with the relative frequency of yield decline. There were no significant predictors for rice. These results suggest that both economic and biophysical factors have played a role in limiting cereal yield growth.},

  Abstract                 = {The study of commodity price behaviour has attracts the attention of many economists and finance specialists. This is due to the fact that many less developed countries rely on the revenues generated by the commodity exports. In this paper, the nonlinear relationship because of regime shifts in four vegetable oil price series was investigated. The multivariate Markov switching vector autoregressive (MS-VAR) model with regime shifts in both the mean and the variance was employed to capture common regime shifts behaviour among the four price series. Results revealed that all the series demonstrate common regime shifts trend of declining and increasing. In addition, the MS-VAR model fitted the data better than the linear vector autoregressive model (VAR).},

Price series are found to be first-differenced stationary and cointegrated. Our results provide evidence that the United States, Australia, the European Union and Argentina react to Canada's pricing decisions, whereas Canada does not respond to any other price changes except Australia's. Similarly, the United States also plays a strong role in the pricing of other exporters (except Canada) and its pricing decision is affected by changes in Canadian and Australian prices. The remaining exporters such as the European Union and Argentina respond to the {U.S.} and Canadian price changes but do not have any influence on other prices. Overall, our results suggest that there is no distinct price leader in the international wheat market.},

  Abstract                 = {Most wheat exports are accounted for by a limited number of countries with different policy regimes and specializing, for the most part, in particular classes of wheat. Under these circumstances, there is likely to be considerable interaction among the major exporting countries in the determination of wheat prices. In this paper, price linkages between the {U.S.} and other exporting countries {(Canada}, the European Union, Argentina and Australia) in the world wheat market are investigated. After determining that the direction of causality is from U. S. prices to the prices of other exporting countries, the nature of the price linkages is studied. The results suggest that the major exporting countries respond asymmetrically to {U.S.} price changes. The degree of asymmetry differs from one exporting country to another, Argentina and the European Union show greater response to falling prices than to rising prices, while the opposite is true for Canada and Australia.},

The results suggest that both {U.S.} durum and hard spring wheat prices respond to restore equilibrium relationships with the corresponding Canadian price, while the Canadian prices do not. That is, the structure of the respective policies is such that the Canadian markets are largely insulated from influences flowing directly from the {U.S.}, while {U.S.} markets are not insulated from Canadian influences. These results could be interpreted to support the contention that Canadian production subsidies and the implicit export subsidies would tend to undermine the {U.S.} price support program. The results also support the price leadership role for Canada in the durum and hard spring wheat markets. The implication is that with respect to durum and spring wheats, {U.S.} policies to artificially support domestic prices are not effective over the long run.},

  Abstract                 = {The outcome of the "race" between population and food is of enduring contemporary interest. The two variables that are set opposite each other in the race are fundamentally different in character. Population is primarily a stock concept that rises monotonically, whereas food production is overwhelmingly a flow variable that exhibits substantial year-to-year fluctuations. These latter fluctuations, in turn, cause significant economic and nutritional consequences at the household level. Assessing the pattern of these annual fluctuations in cereal yields with respect to their magnitude, geographic incidence, and change over time is thus of evident interest in questions concerning food security. This article assesses the growth and variability of corn, wheat, and rice yields from 1950 to 1994 on a global and regional basis. The results suggest that any broadly held notions of greatly increasing instability in global grain yields are probably wrong. More important, yield variability has not risen significantly between 1950 and 1994 in the developing world as a whole. Instability in corn yields has increased, however, in the developed world--particularly in North America--and in Africa. Higher yield variability is not necessarily a portent of disaster, but adjustments in trade, livestock, or storage are not instantaneous, automatic, or costless. Even world-food "optimists" need to worry about the possible effects of two or three successive "bad" corn crops in North America.},
